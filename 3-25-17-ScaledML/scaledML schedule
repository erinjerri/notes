Scaled Machine Learning

Stanford University
March 25th 2017, 8:30am - 6:00pm
Machine Learning is evolving to utilize new hardware such as GPUs and large commodity clusters. University and industry researchers have been using these new computing platforms to scale machine learning across many dimensions.

This conference aims to bring together researchers running machine learning algorithms on a variety of computing platforms to foster discussions between them. The goal is to encourage algorithm designers for these platforms to help each other scale and transplant ideas between the platforms.
